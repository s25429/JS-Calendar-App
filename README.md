## General Information
It is a simple calendar web app and there is not much more to it. Idea was to create something functional using dates and so on. It is not really optimized for various resolutions, because that was not the goal. Best is to view it on a desktop.\ 
I was heavily inspired by a calendar app made by Alex Cramer [here](https://freefrontend.com/assets/img/css-calendars/calendar-6.png).

## Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript ES6+

## Launching and Viewing
- Web app uses JavaScript modules imports, which does not work on locally opened files in the browser. I suggest viewing it through the live demo link.
- To have it all working locally I used VSCode and an extension called Live Server. 
- After cloning the repository and opening VSCode simply install Live Server through Extensions tab, right click on the index.html and then click Open with Live Server. It will take care of everything.
- There are also other ways that will work, like even XAMPP live server, but I have not used those.

## Project Status
Project is fully complete. It works rather well and I have not found any bugs in it as of yet.
